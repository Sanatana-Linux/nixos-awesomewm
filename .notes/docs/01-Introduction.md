# AwesomeWM Tutorial Part 01

## Introduction:

Welcome to an exciting journey at the amorphous frontier of desktop computing interfaces, where anything is possible so long as you are willing to put in the hours of debugging. In this series of tutorials, we shall survey the wild landscape of Awesome Window Manager, a captivating and powerful tiling window management *framework* that empowers you to mold your own desktop environment to be just about anything you can dream up and write out in Lua code. Prepare yourself to embark on one of the most rewarding, if not most frustrating, experiences .

## Understanding the Concepts:

Before we dive into the captivating world of Awesome, let's lay a solid foundation by understanding the underlying concepts that drive this exceptional window manager. Familiarity with these concepts will pave the way for you to unleash the full potential of Awesome.

### Tiling Window Managers:

At the core of Awesome lies the concept of tiling window managers. Unlike conventional window managers, which allow windows to float freely, overlap, or clutter the screen, tiling window managers take an architectural approach. They partition the screen into non-overlapping tiles, allowing each window to occupy its dedicated space. The result is an optimized use of screen real estate, eliminating clutter and providing an organized workspace that enhances productivity.

### Tags and Workspaces:

Tags, a fundamental concept in Awesome, revolutionize the way we manage windows. Tags represent virtual workspaces that enable efficient organization and grouping of windows. Unlike traditional workspaces, Awesome allows windows to exist simultaneously in multiple tags. This flexibility empowers you to tailor your workspace dynamically, effortlessly adapting to the demands of different projects or tasks. Seamlessly switch between tags, and witness the transformation of your workflow.

### Widgets and the Wibox:

The Wibox, a central element of Awesome's allure, comes to life through the concept of widgets. These versatile graphical elements adorn the status bar, providing real-time information and interactivity. From displaying the current time and system statistics to weather updates and media controls, widgets serve as your faithful companions, both functional and aesthetically pleasing. Customize your status bar, sculpting it to reflect your preferences and necessities.

### Configuration and Lua:

To unlock the true potential of Awesome, we must delve into its configuration file, starting with `rc.lua`. Written in the Lua programming language, this file acts as a portal to the realms of customization and personalization. Don't be intimidated if you're not yet fluent in Lua; throughout this series, we will guide you through the steps necessary to master this mighty language. Together, we will navigate the configuration file, molding Awesome to align seamlessly with your unique vision.
