# Configuration Ideas and Updates

- currently the set up works well enough, even if the need for certain adjustments exists
- several really slick configurations I have come across recently that have suggested new paradigms and ideas worth considering (hence this note)
  - [kosorin's configuration](https://github.com/kosorin/awesome-rice)
    - menus for each client, allowing various options to be set like floating, maximized, etc (in place of titlebar, which I would still prefer having)
    - unique use of tables in the theme portion
