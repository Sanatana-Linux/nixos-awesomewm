# App Launcher

This was taken right out of [Bling](https://github.com/BlingCorp/bling), which is an awesome widget library I deeply appreciate but don't really need the rest of the library in this already way oversized code base. 

I have retained the name of the utility files it calls on, the `helpers` and kept them within the widget. I have also kept the call file, which is in the `ui` directory and needs to be initialized to work. Eventually I will probably refactor this and strip out a lot of unnecessary code but for now it works and that is enough.
