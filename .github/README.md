# Sanatana Linux Awesome Window Manager Configuration

Serving as the centerpiece of my NixOS configuration, `Sanatana Linux`, this configuration builds from the AwesomeWM framework a highly personalized and comprehensive GUI front end for my systems that provides all of my expectations for a desktop environment while being incredibly light and responsive.

## Documentation

- For more general documentation about the configuration of AwesomeWM, I am preparing a book at present that will do so. So check back periodically if you are interested as no doubt there will be something about it posted here (and elsewhere).
- The notes specific to this configuration, including working notes like TODO items, are found within the `.notes` directory as Markdown files, my current project notes solution.
    - Links to the notes directory files:
       - [Index](/.notes/index.md) - the frontpage with these links duplicated there upon
       - [TODOs](./todo.md) - TODO items I remembered to record
       - [Additional Resources](/.notes/Additional-Resources.md) - Links to find third party resources or additional information.
       - [Credit Where It is Due](/.notes/Credit-Where-It-Is-Due.md) - acknowledgements of the many other codebases that inspired this one or have had their portions adapted to my use.
       - [Installation](/.notes/Installation.md) - installing this configuration for yourself.
