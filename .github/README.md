# Sanatana Linux Awesome Window Manager Configuration

Serving as the centerpiece of my NixOS configuration, `Sanatana Linux`, this configuration builds from the AwesomeWM framework a highly personalized and comprehensive GUI front end for my systems that provides all of my expectations for a desktop environment while being incredibly light and responsive.

## Documentation

The documentation regarding this configuration, which is written to be useful for configuring AwesomeWM in general, as well as my explanations for various over-arching design choices and more is available in separate Markdown files linked below and included in the `.notes/` directory. Additionally, each subdirectory includes its own `README.md` file to explain the content found there within, generally including a table listing the files it contains and explaining the functionality provided by that file. Finally, in the files themselves, I have adhered to an idiosyncratic but comprehensive method and syntax of explaining the code in comments for my later reference that is written such that others will also understand at least what is going on in the code itself with minimal confusion even if they think my commenting style is excessive (it is but its better than not knowing what code does in 6 months when something breaks).
