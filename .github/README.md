# NixOS AwesomeWM configuration

As part of my NixOS environment, Sanatana Linux, this is the repo from which I craft my Desktop Environment entirely out of AwesomeWM to have the features I want and need while being aesthetically pleasing, at least to me, and not compromising on functionality to create a Fischer-Price like toy interface but one I find more ergonomic than traditional options and fully featured.


## WIP (FOREVER?)
