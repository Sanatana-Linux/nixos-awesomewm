# Introduction

The documentation and working notes related to this project reside within this directory for simplicity's sake and because keeping the notes elsewhere makes loosing them only too easy as I have learned with this project in particular.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Each subdirectory of the repository should have its own `README.md` file that explains its function and lists its content.
