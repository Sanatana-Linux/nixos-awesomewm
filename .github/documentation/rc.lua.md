- [] TODO increase the size of the screenshot notification so the buttons are more easily read
- [] TODO make floating windows and their geometry persist after awesome restart BUT ONLY FOR THOSE INDIVIDUAL WINDOWS
- [] TODO Adjust the theme to pull in colors from either the gtk theme or xresources (xresources would be better, but gtk would be more enduring if I like the color pattern and mesh better)
