# Credit Where It Is Due

1. **AwesomeWM's developers** - these awesome people keep this window manager that has been around for almost 15 years going strong and provided to the community a window manager framework which is wide open for use in a multitude of use cases with ever more features and legacy support long after retiring old features. This has never generated profits, awesome has always been something that the developers volunteer their time to do for the community and for that we owe them an immense debt of gratitude and should answer such a gift by paying it forward and offering what we can to the community for the same low, low price and high quality efforts. 

2. **The Community** - Awesome is kept alive by the vibrant and impressive community of users of all varieties. Not only does this community consist of the `r/unixporn` crowd at the bleeding edge of desktop Linux design and pioneering new desktop experiences actively to such impressive results but it is also overwhelmingly average users with more humble aspirations and simpler configurations that are just as much part of the community and in posting their code to public repositories, no less inspiring nor less impressive as the more code that there is, the wider the net with which we can show people the truly amazing things desktop Linux/BSD/Unix-like systems can be (sorry macOS I don't think you are supported anymore). 

3. **The Open Source Community at Large** - *Nix desktop customization is a niche within a wider ecosystem of open source software that has demonstrated that the constraining of ideas by using patent courts to prevent ideas from being stolen when hardly any one person's in the first place is not the best nor most efficient way to move technology forward but instead is pushed forward by those so irritated with something not functioning they fix it themselves and many less irritable volunteers devoting time to improving human technology sheerly out of interest in doing so and knowledge of the code and version control system.
