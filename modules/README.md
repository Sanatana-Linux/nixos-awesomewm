# Modules

> Module: A module in Awesome Window Manager refers to a self-contained unit of functionality that provides a set of features or services. It is typically a Lua script that can be loaded and configured within the Awesome configuration file (`rc.lua`). Modules can provide various capabilities, such as managing key bindings, defining layouts, handling notifications, or controlling window behavior. Examples of modules in Awesome include the "awful" module (providing core functionality), the "beautiful" module (managing themes), and the "wibox" module (creating status bars).
