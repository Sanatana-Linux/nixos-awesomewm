# Signal

These are essentially internal daemons that are called by the widgets that query data from them, thus they are not called in the `rc.lua` file (which they could be, it wouldn't change anything I hope). They watch for conditions and perform actions either at a certain time interval (like checking memory usage) or when a condition is met (like picom shuts off). Typically, they interact with the system via some sort of shell command that is run at the time interval or condition met event. The resulting output from the shell command is fed back to the widgets interested either through an `awesome.emit_signal` or function call. These seemingly trivial functions do provide the configuration with a lot of power in providing a channel of access between the configuration's widgets and the underlying system, which is tailored to my system running the distro I run, so adapting them may require a bit of rewriting just FYI.
